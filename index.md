# Second Milestone
My second milestone was adding both servos and creating the hand/claw that will be attached to the second servo(Push Servo). When I was attaching the Rotate Servo to the mechanism, I realised that the space was too large so I had to add an additional box below. With this problem solved; it was time to glue\ the push servo which

# First Milestone
  
My first milestone was building the wooden part of the mechanism including the cube-holding tray. First step towards reaching that point was planning and calculating the measurements. I knew that the calculation had to be precise because such a heavy piece of wood resting on an angled wood with minimal support will be difficult. After the measurement were ready I straightaway started to attach the wooden slab and quickly realised due to the angle of the wood it wont be able to stand with one edge. In order to overcome that I added additional support piece which formed a triangle. Afterwards I attached the fourth piece of wood to another piece already attached and used popsicle sticks as support. After building the main structure, I made the cube-holding tray using popsicle sticks and a box that was just a bit larger than the Rubik's Cube. This tray will be glued to one of the servos(which I called "Rotate Servo") and will move the layers.
